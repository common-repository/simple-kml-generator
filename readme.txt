Plugin for generating KML files for Google Maps and Google Earth.

== Description ==

You can generate KML marker lists with Google Maps "My Places" function, but it has limited marker and sometimes it is not easy to manage those markers.

With Simple KML Generator, you can create multiple KML marker lists with this plugin easily.
With the 400+ marker icons (by Maps Icons Collection), you can customize your KML markers nicely.

The full document can be found in [Github](https://github.com/kingkong123/wp-kml-generator).

*This plugin does not come with front end map, but it generate location lists for use in Google Map*
